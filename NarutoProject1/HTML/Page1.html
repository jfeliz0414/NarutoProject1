        Imagine it is 2005 and you just came back from school.<br />
        The first thing you do is most likely relax, and grab a bite to eat while watching TV.<br>
        You change the channel to Cartoon Network and Dragon Ball Z is on. <br>
        After some time something happens, something that would create a heavy western audiance for over a decade.
        That something you ask? <br>

            That's Naruto, a story about a boy going from being hated by most people in the village to becoming the leader of his ninja village. Which they call it in this show a "Hokage" which means Fire Shadow in Japanese.
            It is a fantastic story about growth, understanding, self doubt, hard work, and coming of age.
            If you enjoy action, you enjoy comedy, but you enjoy character growth. This is the story you should read.
